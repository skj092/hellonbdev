# Identify The Dance Form
> Identify the dance form is a machine learning competition hosted by hackerearth: a platform where you can learn coding and machine learning. I'll use the dataset of this competition for my course project 'Deep Learning with Pytorch: Zero to GANs' : a free course provided by jovian.ml and freecode camp. For more information visit. 


```python
say_hello('sonu')
```




    'Hello sonu!'
